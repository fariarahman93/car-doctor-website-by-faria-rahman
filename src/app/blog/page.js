              Owning a car comes with the responsibility of keeping it in good shape. Regular car maintenance is not just about keeping your vehicle running smoothly—it's also a smart way to avoid expensive repairs down the road. In this post, we’ll cover essential car care tips to help you stay ahead of potential issues, saving you both time and money.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Keep Your Fluids in Check</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Fluids are the lifeblood of your car, and neglecting them can lead to costly repairs. Regularly check your engine oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, and coolant levels. Proper fluid levels help your car function optimally and prevent overheating or damage to critical components.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Don’t Skip Your Oil Change</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                One of the simplest and most effective ways to prolong your engine's life is to change the oil regularly. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes less effective at lubricating the engine. At Affordable Car Service, we recommend oil changes every 5,000 miles or as advised by your car's manufacturer.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Rotate Your Tires for Even Wear</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Tire rotations are often overlooked, but they are vital for ensuring even wear across all four tires. This simple service helps you get the most out of your tires, extending their life and improving your car’s safety. Uneven tires can also reduce fuel efficiency.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Check Your Brakes Regularly</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Your brakes are your car’s most important safety feature, so it’s critical to have them checked regularly. Listen for squealing or grinding sounds, which can be indicators that your brake pads are worn out. Catching these issues early can prevent expensive repairs down the line.
              </p>
  
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Inspect Your Battery</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                A dead battery is never fun, especially when you’re on the go. Most batteries last 3-5 years, but it’s a good idea to have it tested regularly, especially before winter months when the cold can take a toll. Replacing your battery on time can save you from inconvenient breakdowns.
